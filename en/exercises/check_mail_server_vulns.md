#### Insecure Email Connections

##### Summary

A common issue with e-mail services is the lack of proper encryption. Staff should only be allowed to connect to the organization’s mail server using SSL or TLS encryption. 

When a staff member sends or receives email an attacker with access to the same local network can easily and invisibly read, record, or modify all messages in-transit to and from the organization’s mail server.

Even an informed staff member who attempts to configure his email client to require SSL or TLS encryption will be unable to do so because the mail server does not support it.

The adversary could be someone, such as a patron of the Internet cafe where a staff member is working, who just happens to be using the same local network to connect to the Internet. Or, she could work for an organization with privileged access to the relevant network, such as %{organization}’s Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Even an informed staff member who attempts to configure his email client to require SSL or TLS encryption will be unable to do so because the mail server does not support it. For webmail, a staff member who attempts to enter the secure (“https://”;) alternative webmail address when logging in, might be unable to do so, because the Webmail application does not support it.

To capture outgoing (SMTP) messages, the process is nearly identical to the traffic monitoring exercise.

```

Sample Output:

```
00:11:22:33:44:55 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.1.1 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55

```

In the example above, only a single victim (192.168.1.99) is being targeted, but the attack works fine against multiple victims, or even against the entire network. In other words, the attacker does not need to know which IP address (on the office or Internet cafe LAN, for example) belongs to the target.

```
$ sslstrip -a -l 12345 -w sslstrip.log

The attacker then uses iptables to route a portion of the victim’s traffic (in this case, IMAP traffic destined for port 143) through the SSLStrip tool, which rewrites headers such that responses come to them first, before continuing along to the victim. The attacker then monitors the tool’s output for email messages:

```
$ iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 143 –j REDIRECT --to-port 12345
$ tail -f sslstrip.log
```

(For POP3, the attacker would use port 110 instead of port 143, but the attack is otherwise identical.) At this point, the contents of the sslstrip.log file contains a copy of incoming IMAP traffic, including any email messages the victim might read while being observed.
