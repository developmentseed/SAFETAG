"*Finding threats against arbitrary things is fun, but when you're building some-thing with many moving parts, you need to know where to start, and how to approach it.*" - _Threat Modeling: Designing for Security_ by Adam Shostack [^shostack_finding_threats]

"*When you are developing your security plans, consider how elements of acceptance, protection and deterrence can expand the menu of options you have at your disposal.*

*Also, where there is an organisational commitment and culture of security the individual is more likely to adhere to agreed security measures. The risk of individual security plans is that they become personal good intentions that get thrown out when things are hectic.*"- _Workbook on Security: Practical Steps for Human Rights Defenders at Risk_ [^workbook_on_security]
