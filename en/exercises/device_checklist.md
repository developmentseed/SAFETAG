- Popular operating systems like Windows XP are, sadly, no longer receiving security
  updates. Upgrade to the latest version keeping in mind the system requirements of
  the version selected. For Windows, review the [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)
  for upcoming "EOLs" (End of Life). Apple does not publish EOL schedules, but historically
  releases security updates for their current and two prior releases.
- While "pirated" operating systems and software are extremely common (especially
  for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security.  If the OS
  or Software is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely
  vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended
  Free Open Source Software

- '**If Outdated - Update Operating Systems and Other Software**'
- Operating Systems and Softwares of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and others,
  are constantly being updated.  These updates often fix bugs, but they also protect
  the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities.  It can seem difficult to keep
  updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.
- '**If Vulnerable Software - Update Vulnerable Software**'
- Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities
  and need to be aggressively updated. If there are not needed for work by the users,
  uninstall them
- '**If No Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware Scanner - Install Anti-Virus and Anti-Maware
  Scanner**'
- An Anti-virus and Anti-malware offer some minimal protection to the system and therefore
  is important to have them installed.
- '**If Outdated Anti-Virus - Update Anti-Virus**'
- Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or if
  the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its trial period.  An
  out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that continuous udpdating
  of AV is done.
- '**If Unencrypted Drive  - Encrypt Hard Drives**'
- When possible, build-in drive encryption (Filevault on OSX, BitLockeron Windows,
  and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly experiences. VeraCrypt
  offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna also create encrypted drives
  which can be shared across platforms.
- '**If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If present)**'
- Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both office

  office natworking (file sharing, printing, etc.) is essential unless alternatives

#### Device and Behaviour Assessment

##### Summary

The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus and other security capabilities, and identifies software running on computers and its current version.  The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any out of date software.

This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software can lead to large vulnerabilities.

##### Overview

 * Identify what privilege level services are running under -- Are users using accounts with admin privileges, or are they using another user and have to type in a password to get admin rights? [^privilege-separation-across-os]
 * Check for existence and status of anti-virus (and anti-malware tools) on the device. [^anti-virus-updates]
 * Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. [^identifying-software-versions]
 * Identify what level of encryption is being used and is available for data storage on the device. [^device_encryption_by_os]
 * Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.


##### Materials Needed

* A notepad may be useful

##### Considerations

* Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e. explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in aggregate.

###### Variant: Windows


If Windows is not your primary OS, you can download sample Virtual Machines (with time limitations) from Microsoft through their project to improve IE support via https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads (see also http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/download-windows-xp-for-free-and-legally-straight-from-microsoft-si/ and https://modernievirt.blob.core.windows.net/vhd/virtualmachine_instructions_2014-01-21.pdf)

**Windows 10**

* OS Security Updates

GUI: Start --Settings --Update & Security --Windows Update

* Services Running

GUI: Start, type "Task Manager"

**Windows 8**

 * OS Security Updates

 Control Panel Programs and features installed updates

 CLI:
 http://www.techsupportalert.com/en/quick-and-easy-way-list-all-windows-updates-installed-your-system.htm


 * Firewall

GUI: Start (or Down Arrow Icon, PC Settings) -- Control Panel -- Windows Firewall
CLI:
```Netsh Advfirewall show allprofiles```

more detail: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish
