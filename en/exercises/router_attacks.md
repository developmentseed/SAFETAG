#### Router Based Attacks

##### Summary

Many wireless routers still use the default password listed in [“Router Default Password Search”](http://www.routerpasswords.com/), meaning that anyone with access to the network could also take complete control of the router - adding in remote access tools or setting up other attacks.

##### Overview

  * Find the router(s) (``route`` works well for this)
  * Test using default passwords
  * Check for upgrades / un-patched vulnerabilities and backdoors
  * Investigate potentially valuable data (logs, connected users)
