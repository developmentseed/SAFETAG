#### Regional Context Research

##### Summary
This exercise focuses on research and re-confirmation of regional issues from general trends to specific legal restrictions and safety concerns, as well as current news and persistent challenges. 

##### Overview

* Identify any legal risks associated with conducting the audit (Secure communications and storage, network forensics, device exploitation, digital security training.) [^PETS_legal_considerations]
* Determine the sensitivity of the type of work the organization conducts and if its work attracts additional potential threat actors.
* Identify potential adversaries not identified in interviews including domestic or international governments and other, non-state actors (organized crime, corporations, competition, etc).
* Identify capacity and willingness of potential adversaries to act against the organization.
* Has any organization or individual made specific threats, or demonstrated intention or mindset to attack on the organization or similar organizations?

##### Materials Needed

##### Considerations

* Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.
* Maintain data about any targeted attacks and attacks affecting the organization's line of work secure.

##### Walkthrough

Cross-check reports on [regional threats](#Threat-research-by-region) facing organizations with their [focus area](#Threat-research-by-topic).

  * Targeted Threats
    * List all the relevant actors and their relationship with similar organizations.
    * List all present threats and upcoming threats to similar organizations.
    * List all documented instances of relevant actors carrying out these threats.	

  * Decentralized Threats
    * List all present threats and upcoming threats to similar organizations.
    * Identify the motivation for these threats.
    * List all documented instances of these threats being carried out.

Identify any [legal risks](#technical-threats-by-region) associated with conducting the audit. Secure communications and storage, network forensics, device exploitation, digital security training.

  * Identify any export/import controls that might put the auditor or the organization at risk.
  * Identify any domestic laws and regulations that might put the auditor or the organization at risk.

Identify any [infrastructural barriers](#communications-infrastructure-research) to adopting digital security practices.

Explore the security landscape of hardware and software identified in interviews by conducting a basic [vulnerability analysis.](#vulnerability-analysis)
