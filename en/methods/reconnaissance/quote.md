"*Good social engineering thus requires some knowledge of a target’s contacts, areas of interest, and current priorities or activities. It is likely that attackers conduct some form of preliminary reconnaissance or otherwise “study up” on their targets to develop their social engineering, perhaps drawing on social media and other open source information, or leveraging information or credentials gleaned from existing access to the systems of others within the target’s circle of trust (what might be called “collateral compromise”). Thus attackers appear to invest primarily in knowing their targets, rather than creating or purchasing advanced malware.*" _Communities @ Risk: Targeted Digital Threats Against Civil Society_ [^citi_lab_exec_recon]
