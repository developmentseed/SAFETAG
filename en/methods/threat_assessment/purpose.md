Checking the assumptions both of the organization and of the auditor by researching the current threats will ensure that an auditor is basing their work on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations. With greater ownership of the process the staff provides an opportunity to explore their threat landscape and become more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. By engaging with as many staff as possible the auditor is providing a framework for staff to explore threat identification processes when the auditor is gone.
