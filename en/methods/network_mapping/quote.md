"*A surprisingly common response from IT administrators, when confronted with a significant local vulnerability, is something like, 'Sure but that’s all inside the firewall, right?' Often, this statement is technically correct—that is, after all, the point of a firewall—but one hears this even from staff who are well aware that their wireless password is the name of the organization.*"

"*Most people demonstrate a cognitive response to digital threat, but there is very little emotional reaction. We know that these things are dangerous, but we don’t feel threatened. Security trainers need to help people feel the danger, not merely think about it...*

*So the question remains, how do we evoke the healthy emotional responses that motivate adult human beings to protect themselves against dangers that they were not warned about as children? Merely describing the threat in an abstract way is unlikely to be effective. Rather, we need to emphasize the human impact of the threat and its relevance to the individual. This is most easily accomplished by telling stories!*"- _The Psychological Underpinnings of Security Training_ [^psych_sec_training]

"*Testing must specifically target only [wireless emissions] from personnel who are under direct legal contract with the scope owner, computer systems on the property of the scope owner, and EM or MW signals or emanations of power level great enough to disrupt or harm wireless communications within the scope. Analysts must make efforts to not invade upon a person’s private life such as listening to or recording personal communications originating within the scope, where that private life has made efforts to separate itself from the scope.*" - _Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)_ [^OSSTMM_wireless_security_testing]
