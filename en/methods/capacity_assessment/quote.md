"*In human rights organisations where the HRDs are at risk, an organisational security plan will help to protect the workers and allow them to do their work more effectively. If your organisation acknowledges and plans for dealing with the risks, the staff and/or members will feel more supported and have increased allegiance to the organisation and its important work.*" - _Workbook on Security: Practical Steps for Human Rights Defenders at Risk_ [^workbook_on_security]

"*Keep in mind that the most sensitive and efficient way to interview a participant is through an ‘in-person’ conversation (that is, face-to-face or by telephone). If this is not possible, e-mail is an alternative. However, ensure that this is a secure e-mail conversation. It may be best for facilitators and participants to open separate secure e-mail accounts for this purpose – ‘hushmail’ is just one example, but note that e-mail security levels can change over time and in different geographic locations, so it is best to check with communication security experts to identify the most secure option. Bear in mind, too, that participants may find the questions more difficult to answer by e-mail.*" - _Integrated Security: The Manual_ [^integrated_security_manual]
