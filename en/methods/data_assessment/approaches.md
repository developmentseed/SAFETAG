* **Data Mapping Activity:** Have staff identify where that data is currently (what devices/physical locations), who has access (physical, login, permissions), and who needs to have access to get the organizations work completed.
*  **Risks of Data Lost and Found Activity:** Have rank the impact if different data within the organization was lost, and if adversaries gained access to that data.
* **Private Data Activity:** Guide staff through an activity to have them list private data within the organization [^personal_information_to_keep_private]

If it was not possible to conduct these activities in person, you can conduct them remotely through applying one of the remote facilitation approaches described in the [Remote Facilitation](#appendix-remote-facilitation) appendix.
