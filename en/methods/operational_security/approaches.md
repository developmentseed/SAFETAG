* **Physical Access to the Lan, wifi, and Servers:** Tour the office and look for exposed network devices, servers, and network jacks, document how difficult it would be for a visitor or after-hours break-in to access sensitive systems. Determine the reach of the wireless network and how easy it is to identify it as connected to the organization.
* **Mapping potential physical vulnerabilities with digital security impacts:**  Document potential vulnerabilities to the organization's information security based on physical aspects -- e.g. unencrypted devices which could be stolen, written passwords, or even wireless network metadata.
* **A Day In the Life:** Have staff walk you through a usual "day in their life" showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and what data they have to interact with to conduct their work.
