"*No matter how much effort you have put into building a digital barrier around your computer, you could still wake up one morning to find that it, or a copy of the information on it, has been lost, stolen, or damaged by any number of unfortunate accidents or malicious acts. Anything from a power surge to an open window to a spilt cup of coffee might lead to a situation in which all of your data are lost and you are no longer able to use your computer. A careful risk assessment, a consistent effort to maintain a healthy computing environment and a written security policy can help avoid this type of disaster.*" - _Security in a Box_ [^security_in_a_box_physical]
