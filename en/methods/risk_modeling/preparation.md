* Risk Modeling and Proccess Mapping exercises can be intense and challenging to facilitate.   Risk modeling will require a mixed approach of exercises, and the order which you identify each component will vary depending upon the organization. Prepare and review your exercises, and plan for how they will flow together. Note your specific desired outcomes to easily recover or re-direct the activity based on emergent needs.
