* One-on-One interviews with staff to supplement other group activities.
* Risk identification based on process or data mappings
* A classic group [Risk Assessment Activity](http://frontlinedefenders.org/files/workbook_eng.pdf#page=9).

If it was not possible to conduct these activities in person, you can conduct them remotely through applying one of the remote facilitation approaches described in the [Remote Facilitation](#appendix-remote-facilitation) appendix.
