* If you are providing software tools, make sure to check file signatures (and explain the process) - do not be the weak link or introduce malware into the organization!
* Do not attempt to train on any topic that you are not knowledgeable on.
* For any targeted training, especially on new tools, ensure that key personnel at the organization successfully use these tools during the audit timeline. This is especially important for secure communications tools the auditor hopes to use to follow-up with the organization.
* For any specific fixes or upgrades to the system, make sure that backups exist and to test extensively and with staff involvement after your intervention.
