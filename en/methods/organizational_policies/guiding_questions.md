* Are there documented policies or practices, including any employee onboarding guidance?
* What is the level of formality of the security practices in place? are verbal conventions, written documents or something in between?
* What is the understanding by the management and/or staff on common security practices?
* Are there presumptions being made by some staff which are not shared?
* How are any of these implemented / required / verified within existing organizational practice?

Specific aspects to explore are:

* Password expectations (password management, complexity, requirements
* entry/exit policies and account management
* information classification that limits access (e.g. who has access to financial data? partner data?)
* Backups
* Acceptable use policies (what can and cannot staff do with their work devices)
* Travel policies (VPN usage, etc.)
