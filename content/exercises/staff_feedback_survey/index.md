#### Staff Feedback Survey

##### Summary


Providing a space for anonymous, guided feedback is valuable to gather information about how your audit work and the SAFETAG framework itself are supporting organizational understanding of risk and their ability to adapt. This long-term capacity building is critical to the SAFETAG framework, so finding ways to measure the impact of an audit towards these goals is important.

##### Overview

* After providing a report to the organization, send them a survey (that they can complete anonymously) to gauge change in perceptions of risk, your efficacy as an auditor, and willingness to change/adapt
* Compile results

##### Materials Needed

* Survey questions
* Platform or document for securely recording survey responses

##### Considerations

* Provide this survey in a method that respects the client's need for privacy, security, and anonymity. 


##### Walkthrough

This exercise provides a simple survey you can implement in a variety of settings (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, via plain documents, etc.).
