#### Roadmap Development

##### Summary
This component consists of an auditor sorting their recommendations in relation to the organizations threats and capacity. The auditor prioritizes vulnerabilities, weighs the implementation costs of recommendations and then creates an actionable roadmap for the organization to make their own informed choices about possible next steps as they move forward. 


##### Overview

As part of SAFETAG's dedication to building agency and supporting organizational adoption of safer practices, a careful prioritization of vulnerabilities is invaluable in keeping audit results from appearing overwhelming. An organization needs to be able to weigh their possible paths forward against the time lost from program activities, the cost to implement the threat, and the other threats that they are not addressing.  Roadmapping is used to give the host the tools to make these decisions and provide them with a recommended path forward that will allow them to make immediate gains towards protecting themselves. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.

##### Materials Needed

##### Considerations
  * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
  * The roadmap may be shared with local IT support, digital security trainers, possible funders, or other consultants in part, or in full. Consider the content in light of this.
    * Individual vulnerabilities should be able to be read, and acted upon, independently from the rest of the report so that the organization can easily provide only the required information for follow up work.
	* The overall posture and risk/ranking profile components should be able to be read independent from the risk model and be free of any specific vulnerabilities to allow the organization to easily provide trusted invested parties with an overview of the results/need without exposing any specific vulnerabilities.
  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organizationâ€™s country, or is known to surveil.

##### Walkthrough

* Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed.
* Based upon the organizational capacity assessment, build a menu that builds upon the organizational strengths to create a path forward that provides achievable outcomes, maintains agency, and steps towards long-term difficult outcomes with high reward for the host.

* **Implementation Matrix Development:** Create an "implementation matrix." with the urgency of the threat addressed balanced by the difficulty of implementation given available organizational capacity for the recommendations.
* **Roadmap Development:** Identify critical vulnerabilities, with achievable recommendations that fit into threat narratives that you heard from staff during the audit to create a remediation roadmap for addressing the threats faced by the organization. Include a short description of why each recommendation (and corresponding threat) was ranked with the urgency it was assigned.
* **Documenting Existing Successes:** Place the  recommendations on a time-line that includes the existing practices of the organization to show that the remediation process is a continuation of the hosts existing in/formal security practices. [^shostack_anchoring]
