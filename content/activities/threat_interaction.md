summary: >

  This helps the auditor enumerate threats that the organization is concerned
  about and the internal priorities of them.  At the same time, it enables a
  discussion of how threats can interrelate and helps define the difference
  between a threat and a risk (a threat that has a vulnerability associated with
  it), and the value of mitigation.


  This exercise works well with larger groups, and can be woven in to the Threat
  Identification activity.
overview: >+

  * Split participants into small groups and have them brainstorm on all
  possible threats, writing each on a separate stickie

  * Cluster the stickies to reveal duplicate concerns across the group and
  thematic areas

  * Mark the threats which have occurred

  * Select one threat and arrange other threats, where relevant, as potential
  causes or outcomes of that threat


  **Expected Outputs**


  * List of threats and some level of prioritization based on concern

  * Historical threat information for the organization

  * Improved staff understanding of risk

  * Auditor should be able to fill in the below threat analysis worksheet

materials_needed: |

  * Stickies (ideally 3 colors)
  * Pens/sharpies for participant groups
  * Markers
  * Camera to digitally capture the data
  * Whiteboard or flip-chart
considerations: |2

    * Treat threat and adversary data with the utmost security.
    * Ensure that any physical notes/drawings are erased and destroyed once digitally recorded.
    * Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure and encrypted.
    * Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.
