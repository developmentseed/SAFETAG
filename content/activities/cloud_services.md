summary: >

  During the organizational assessment you will almost certainly come across 3rd
  party cloud-based service providers being used by the audited organization.
  The organization may be interested in your assessment of the security of those
  services. This poses several challenges to you as an auditor:

      * auditing 3rd party web applications almost certainly falls outside of the scope of the audit engagement
      * you likely do not have an agreement with the service provider to scan their application
      * a proper assessment would take more time than is available for the organizational audit
      * you may not be familiar with the service or technology it is built on

  Despite these challenges, significant organizational processes and sensitive
  data may reside on or rely upon those 3rd party applications. It can be
  important to the audit to provide some preliminary investigation and risk
  assessment into the usage of any 3rd party cloud services they rely upon.
overview: >

  * Review organization's use of cloud services (which services, what data,
  access policies)

  * Review formal policies of cloud services in use

  * Search for historical security problems with each provider and their
  response to it.


  **Expected Outputs**


  * A list of all identified 3rd party / cloud services in use

  * A mapping of what data and metadata and which users have access on which
  providers
materials_needed: ''
considerations: >

  * Auditing 3rd party services **must be negotiated directly with the service
  provider** and adds significant complexity to the process (and would normally
  fall out of scope).  There are often serious legal issues involved in auditing
  outside of a formal, signed agreement.
walk_through: >

  It is increasingly difficult to run complex organizations without some
  reliance on cloud-based service providers such as email hosting, web hosting,
  or document management/backup. Organizations (and as assisted by the auditor)
  should review their options in the selection of cloud providers, and in
  parallel consider ways to apply practices and policies to their use to meet
  organizational security requirements.
