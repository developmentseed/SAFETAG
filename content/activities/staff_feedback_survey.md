summary: >


  Providing a space for anonymous, guided feedback is valuable to gather
  information about how your audit work and the SAFETAG framework itself are
  supporting organizational understanding of risk and their ability to adapt.
  This long-term capacity building is critical to the SAFETAG framework, so
  finding ways to measure the impact of an audit towards these goals is
  important.
