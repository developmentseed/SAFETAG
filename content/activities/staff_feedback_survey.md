summary: >


  Providing a space for anonymous, guided feedback is valuable to gather
  information about how your audit work and the SAFETAG framework itself are
  supporting organizational understanding of risk and their ability to adapt.
  This long-term capacity building is critical to the SAFETAG framework, so
  finding ways to measure the impact of an audit towards these goals is
  important.
overview: >

  * After providing a report to the organization, send them a survey (that they
  can complete anonymously) to gauge change in perceptions of risk, your
  efficacy as an auditor, and willingness to change/adapt

  * Compile results
materials_needed: |

  * Survey questions
  * Platform or document for securely recording survey responses
considerations: >+

  * Provide this survey in a method that respects the client's need for privacy,
  security, and anonymity.
