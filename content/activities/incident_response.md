summary: >
  Incident Response setups up a procedure for identifying what counts as an
  incident during an audit, as well as incident handling and response in the
  event the auditor causes or uncovers a security incident during the course of
  the assessment. [^NIST_SP_800-115-Section_7.1]^,^[^PETS_emergency_contact]


  It is important to know these procedures in handling incidents to protect data
  integrity and create an audit trail to be used for investigation and
  collection of information.

considerations: >

  * Having an established emergency contact through the agreement process is
  critical

  * A clear understanding of the legal and technical context from the Context
  Research method will be critical in choosing how to proceed.

  * Consider moving sensitive conversations to a separate, offsite location.
walk_through: >

  What counts as an incident should be agreed with the organization's management
  during the agreement phase, and should include possibilities informed by the
  Context and Technical Research work.


  Incidents can include problems such as insider threats, active remote access
  malware systems, or the discovery of physical surveillance of the office, as
  well as many other possibilities.  The auditor must use their best judgement
  along the SAFETAG Auditor Code of Conduct, their agreement with the
  organization, personal ethics, legal responsibilities, and balance this in the
  frame of the organization's context, capacity, and the need to in good faith
  gain the trust of the staff of the organization to fulfil a successful audit.
