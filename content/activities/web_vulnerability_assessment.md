summary: >
  Organizational websites are often a central part of their work, but resource
  constraints can leave them vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks, from
  simple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks to being leveraged for
  online scams and malicious advertisin to targeted distruction and subversion.
  Insecure websites can even be used in "watering hole" attacks where malware is
  implanted into the site to intentionally target the website's audience.


  This activity provides a SAFETAG auditor with a suite of processes and tools
  to investigate organization and project websites for potential
  vulnerabilities.  There are multiple ways to do this, from passive to more
  active scanning. SAFETAG takes great care to take a primarily passive approach
  to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended
  consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational
  security concerns. Care should be taken to review operational security
  concerns, work closely with the organization, and pursue a minimal approach
  focused on the priorities of the organization. See also the Vulnerability
  Scanning activity for additional tools and approaches useful for investigating
  outside of the website itself the server level.
overview: >
  * Understand the current infrastructure the website is using on the level of
  the hosting provider, location, Operating system

  * Identify the public IP address of the server you will be auditing as you
  will see in some cases, websites are using proxies or DDoS mitigation services
  that mask the real IP address of a server

  * In the case of shared hosting, identify the hosting service and the current
  package

  * Identify the web server, applications in use & plugins, themes, security
  protocols in place and users' session management

  * Identify mis-configurations, sensitive information publicly available,
  metadata embedded within the web application

  * Look for forgotten or insecure support applications like /phpmyadmin

  * Run automated vulnerability scans against websites hosted by the
  organization to identify "low-hanging fruits" especially in the case of
  auditing an open source and common content management system or other web
  applications

  * Perform manual vulnerability assessment and testing to identify server
  mis-configurations, web sessions, tokens etc.

considerations: >
  * Begin with passive techniques and consider if more detail is necessary (e.g.
  would simply upgrading the CMS solve multiple problems). Remember that the
  point is to create a clear, simple path towards security, not a comprehensive
  report on every possible vulnerability

  * Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - *NOTE:*  The
  organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to
  carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the
  organization.

  * Agree on the site(s) to scan and determine the intensity of the process

  * Ensure documented permission and schedule an appropriate time with the site
  host.

  * In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important
  to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the
  website. Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no
  aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.

  * Understand, discover and review the backup options the website has before
  starting the audit process.
walk_through: >
  Performing web vulnerability assessment can be done in different ways, using
  different tools and having different results. Choosing any of these steps or
  guides must not confuse an auditor, but instead, provide a broader scope which
  should help them finding vulnerabilities as many as they can.


  These vulnerabilities can range from:

  - Web Server/OS level vulnerabilities

  - Access control vulnerabilities

  - Application-specific vulnerabilities

  - Misconfiguration

  - SQL Injection

  - Cross-site Scripting

  - Directory Traversal

  - Failure to restrict URL Access

  - Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

  - LDAP Injections

  - Malicious Codes

  - Leaked information


  Before pursuing any of these more active scans, review outputs from passive
  reconnsaisance, DNS history and current information, and (if relevant) CMS
  version checking. This guide covers a small subset of web vulnerability
  scanning tools, a more comprehensive list is available at
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools which
  may provide approaches better suited to specific situations.


  OpenVAS, covered in the vulnerablity scanning activity, also includes Wapiti,
  which can help to detect many of the above common vulnerablitites.
