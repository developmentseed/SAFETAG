  Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are
  thought to be encrypted


  Any attacker who obtains a running (including sleeping and hibernating!)
  Windows, Mac, or even Linux laptop with a Firewire port, an ExpressCard
  expansion slot, or a Thunderbolt port will be able to read, record or modify
  any sensitive information on the device, even if the screen is “locked” and
  the information is stored on an encrypted volume or in an encrypted folder.
  This applies to threats involving loss, theft and confiscation, but also to
  “checkpoint” scenarios in which the attacker may only have access for a few
  minutes.


  This attack requires physical control of a machine that is not powered off.
  Full details of the scope of the attack are available at

  Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are
  thought to be encrypted


  The threat describe in this section is more complex than it needs to be. In
  fact, unencrypted data are vulnerable to any number of simple attacks, the two
  most straightforward being: 1) rebooting the computer from a USB stick CD-ROM
  or DVD containing an alternate operating system, then copying all of the data;
  or 2) removing the hard drive, inserting it into a different machine, then
  copying all of the data. These techniques, which work on nearly any computer,
  even if a strong login password has been set, are effective and widely used,
  but they require extended physical access to the device. A slightly different
  attack is described below, one that only requires physical access for a few
  minutes. It, too, works regardless of login/screen-lock passwords, though only
  devices with Firewire ports or expansion slots (ExpressCard, CardBus, PCMCIA,
  etc.) are vulnerable.


  The steps required to defend against all of these threats is the same: encrypt
  your data using a tool like Microsoft’s BitLocker, Apple’s FileVaule or the
  open-source Truecrypt application. The Firewire attack highlighted here is
  particularly illustrative, however, because it serves as a reminder that
  merely setting up an encrypted volume is not enough. In much the same way that
  a lock does little to protect your home if the door to which it is attached
  remains open, data encryption is rarely effective while you are logged into
  your computer. Even if the screen is locked (which would foil the “reboot” and
  “hard drive removal” attacks described briefly above), an attacker may still
  find a way to access your sensitive data, while the computer is up and
  running, because the decryption key is present in the computer’s memory. (This
  is how large-scale encryption actually works. Information remains encrypted at
  all times, on the storage device where it lives, but you are able to access it
  while you are logged in, or while your encrypted volume is “open,” because
  your computer decrypts and encrypts it on the fly.)

  Walkthrough


  Step 1: First, the attacker would connect her computer to the victim’s using a
  Firewire cable. Either or both machines could be using a true Firewire port or
  a Firewire expansion card. When a Firewire ExpressCard expansion card is
  inserted, Windows automatically installs and configures the necessary drivers,
  even if nobody is logged into the laptop.


  Step 2: Once connected, the attacker simply runs the Inception tool, selects
  the operating system of the target machine and waits a minute or two for the
  attack to complete (depending on the amount of RAM present):


  ```

  *In the case of the laptops tested, Inception took approximately two minutes
  to reach the final, somewhat self-congratulatory line shown above. At that
  point, we were able to login using any password. (Entering “asdf” worked just
  fine, and gave us full access to all data on the computer.) Inception works by
  temporarily replacing authentication code using the Firewire’s protocol’s
  direct memory access (DMA). After a reboot, everything is restored to its
  original state.*


  Once again, it is worth noting that successful mitigation of this issue
  requires a combination of technology (data encryption) and some level of
  behavior change (shutting down laptops at the end of the day, when traveling
  and at any time when confiscation, theft, loss or tampering are particularly
  likely.)
