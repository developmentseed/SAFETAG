summary: >

  The activity aims to assess which kind of informal agreements regarding best
  practices and security directives are formulated, accessed, implemented and/or
  enforced across the organization
overview: >

  * Select a series of situations and operational aspects that could have
  associated some security agreements or policies

  * Ask and discuss with the organization if there are organizational agreements
  regarding the situations and aspects presented

  * Analyze the way these agreements are being transmitted and applied in
  practice

  * Detect the potential gaps in terms of presence and pertinence of effective
  agreements

  * Recommend the building of an strategy to develop, document and transmit as
  needed new or updated security agreements and/or policies

  * Materials for taking notes

walk_through: >

  1. Build a list of situations where security policies, if followed, would
  prevent or reduce the impact of a problem; ideally using the Threat Modeling
  exercise and inputs from Process Mapping, Capacity Assessment, and other
  methods and activities. These situations can be related to regular operations
  (looking for best practices) and risks (looking for security procedures).


  For small and medium sized organizations, arrange group conversations around a
  few specific what-if scenarios (this can be integrated in with the Data
  Mapping or Process Mapping approaches).


  Discussions can include:

    * How passwords are created, used, and shared
    * Who has access to what information (e.g. HR, finance, partners)
    * Destruction/loss of office devices (fire, natural disaster, etc.)
    * Lost devices (e.g. while traveling)
    * Data breach impacting a cloud service used by the organization
    * New people join or leave the organization

  2. Meet with members of the organization and present to them the situations on
  the previous list, asking if there are some codes or agreements regarding
  security aspects of the situations presented, take notes of the responses and
  possible differences between the criteria or knowledge of the agreements. This
  could be explained by the lack of documentation and formal ways to transmit
  the agreements


  3. Build a map of practices in three terms:



  * small org - getting to shared agreements
          * Roundtable without auditor - short internal discussion
          * Run alongside threat ID / process mapping
          * funding and resources


  * What practices are presumed to be in place (e.g. everyone thinks everyone
  else is using unique passwords)

  * What is being applied in practice  (with their possible variations among
  staff members)

  * What needs to be updated or defined
