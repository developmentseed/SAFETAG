summary: >

  This component focuses on assessing and educating organizational staff on how
  to prevent, identify, and respond to social engineering attempts (Phishing,
  information gathering, cons) that lead to Malware and handing over
  authentication tokens/information.


  The educational activities within this section are provided as an alternative
  to actual social engineering attacks against the organization. Audits of
  individual level behavior have a high chance of embarrassing or alienating the
  targeted staff. The result of this embarrassment can range from increased
  enthusiasm for the process to disengaging entirely. Supporting post-audit
  investment in the process is a core component of many activities. The
  possibility of derailing the investment the auditor has built during the audit
  makes social engineering attacks too large of a risk.
  [^stares_and_snide_comments] The security of a organization requires an
  investment by the entire staff. [^social_engineering_important_all] Activities
  like the social engineering activity aim to empower staff to start identifying
  their responsibility for the organizational safety.

    * Participants are better able to identify possible phishing attempts.
    * Participants have a better understanding of how malware on one machine exposes organizational data.

    * Do not use “live” malware in this component. It is tempting to conduct an audit that more closely resembles a penetration test than a vulnerability assessment to expose the dangers of social engineering attacks. Distributing live malware and requires a much higher level of skill and comprehensive understanding of the deployed exploits in order to avoid possible service disruption.

    * (OPTIONAL) Inform staff of the sample "phishing" emails being sent for inspection.
    * (OPTIONAL) Send emails to staff.
    * Bring staff together for an activity where the staff members announce what they thought was suspicious, and the auditor helps reveal anything they missed.
    * Lead staff in an activity identifying what critical data (as identified in during the Data Assessment) would be available to a hacker if malware were to get access to different devices.
