summary: >
  This exercise focuses on research and re-confirmation of regional issues from
  general trends to specific legal restrictions and safety concerns, as well as
  current news and persistent challenges. 
overview: >

  * Identify any legal risks associated with conducting the audit (Secure
  communications and storage, network forensics, device exploitation, digital
  security training.) [^PETS_legal_considerations]

  * Determine the sensitivity of the type of work the organization conducts and
  if its work attracts additional potential threat actors.

  * Identify potential adversaries not identified in interviews including
  domestic or international governments and other, non-state actors (organized
  crime, corporations, competition, etc).

  * Identify capacity and willingness of potential adversaries to act against
  the organization.

  * Has any organization or individual made specific threats, or demonstrated
  intention or mindset to attack on the organization or similar organizations?

considerations: >

  * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is
  highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.

  * Maintain data about any targeted attacks and attacks affecting the
  organization's line of work secure.
walk_through: "\nCross-check reports on [regional threats](#Threat-research-by-region) facing organizations with their [focus area](#Threat-research-by-topic).\n\n  * Targeted Threats\n    * List all the relevant actors and their relationship with similar organizations.\n    * List all present threats and upcoming threats to similar organizations.\n    * List all documented instances of relevant actors carrying out these threats.\t\n\n  * Decentralized Threats\n    * List all present threats and upcoming threats to similar organizations.\n    * Identify the motivation for these threats.\n    * List all documented instances of these threats being carried out.\n\nIdentify any [legal risks](#technical-threats-by-region) associated with conducting the audit. Secure communications and storage, network forensics, device exploitation, digital security training.\n\n  * Identify any export/import controls that might put the auditor or the organization at risk.\n  * Identify any domestic laws and regulations that might put the auditor or the organization at risk.\n\nIdentify any [infrastructural barriers](#communications-infrastructure-research) to adopting digital security practices.\n\nExplore the security landscape of hardware and software identified in interviews by conducting a basic [vulnerability analysis.](#vulnerability-analysis)\n"
