summary: >
  This exercise suggests some targeted online search tools and tricks to gather
  information leakages from organizations.  While many advocacy, activism, and
  media/journalism focused organizations are very public as part of their
  operations, the searches suggested here aim to explore data that could be used
  to better attack or socially engineer an organization.
overview: >

  * Use advanced search tools of major search engines to discover partners,
  projects, and other valuable information about the organization.

  * Social Media / Account Discovery

  * Search pastebin and github style sites for breach and website/software
  development records

  * Use reverse image searching and exif tools on photos of interest

  * Use to add additional data in to, and to research further discoveries from,
  the automated recon work
materials_needed: ''
considerations: >

  * Use VPNs or Tor to conduct your searching. Tor may be blocked by some
  services.

  * Some searches may reveal personal information. Be empathetic and responsible
  with this, even though it is "public" information.
walk_through: >

  These custom and more manual approaches work excellently in combination with
  automated tools such as recon-ng or the commercial Maltego.  Working with both
  these tricks and the automated tools, feeding information learned from one
  back to the other, is a powerful way to unearth large amounts of information
  about an organization.


  Much of the tools and further guidance is well covered in the references for
  the Reconnaissance method, a small selection of starting points is mapped out
  below.


  Take care, however, to not waste time on this; using image information tools
  on every photo on an organization's website, or researching every linked
  social media account may not provide further valuable information - step back
  and judge the value of digging deeper - are you finding adversaries?  Are you
  finding information that the organization may not want online? Are there other
  methods which might be more appropriate to apply?
