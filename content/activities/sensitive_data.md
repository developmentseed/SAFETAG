summary: >

  Data and meta-data about an organization and its staff is incredibly difficult
  to keep track of over time, as people or projects use cloud services like
  Dropbox or Google Drive for some activities, a shared server for others, and a
  mix of work and personal devices (laptops, phones, tablets...).


  This is natural, but it is important to keep track of where your
  organization's data lives and who can access it.
overview: >

  * With staff input, post up popular places where data is kept (laptops, email,
  shared drives...)

  * Using stickies, gather from the staff what data is kept in what locations -
  duplicating notes when needed

  * Rank data by sensitivity

  * Discuss the impact of one of the devices where data is stored being lost -
  are there backups?

  * Discuss the impact of a device being exposed / taken by an adversary

  * Identify who has access (physical access, login access, and permissions),
  and who needs to have access to get the organizations work completed.
materials_needed: >

  * Stickies and markers for activities

  * Flipchart paper

  * One larger sheet of paper taped to wall in landscape orientation, with or
  without prepared titles. (For an example with prepared headings, see the
  matrix below.) The Sensitivity axis is optional in the original exercise, but
  critical for this one. It can be added after the initial round of
  brainstorming however to streamline the flow.


  |Relative Sensitivity|Computer|USB / External Drive|Cloud Storage|Phones,
  Print, etc.|

  |Moderate|||||

considerations: >

  * Some of the stickies generated in this activity may provide sensitive data,
  dispose of them responsibly.

  * If you take photos for reporting needs, save the image files in a secure,
  encrypted container.
walk_through: "\n**Sensitive Data Assessment Activity**\n\n**_Duration: 45 minutes_\t**\n\n*This exercise is adapted from the LevelUp Activity, [Backup Matrix](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/data-backup-basics/activity-discussion/data-backup-matrix-creating-information-map/), part of the curricula for [Data Retrention and Backup](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/data-backup-basics/) by Daniel O'Clunaigh, Ali Ravi, Samir Nassar, and Carol.*\n\n\nExplain to participants that we're going to conduct an information mapping activity to get a sense of where our important information actually is.\n\nStart by listing the different places where our information is stored, according to participants. If no suggestions are forthcoming, we can prompt participants with the obvious stuff:\n\n * Computer hard drives\n * USB flash drives\n * External hard drives\n * Cellphones\n * CDs & DVDs (and BDs)\n * Our email inbox\n * The Cloud: Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, etc\n * Physical copies (or “hard copies”) in the office\n * Multimedia: Video tapes, audio recordings, photographs, etc.\n\nUse large stickies to place these as column headers on a wall.  More will come up later in the course of the exercise.\n\nElicit from participants what type of information or data they have in each of these places. For example:\n\n* Email\n* Contact details, such as a member database\n* Reports/research\n* Funder information / contracts\n* Accounts/spreadsheets\n* Videos\n* Images\n* Private messages on Facebook, etc.\n\nTo encourage participant interaction, write one example on a sticky and place it in the appropriate box in the matrix. Then, ask whether there is another copy of this data somewhere. If there is, you can use another sticky and put it wherever they keep the duplicate.\n\n*TIP:* Place Computers, Phones, and Email next to each other, so you won't have to create duplicates for everything \"stored\" in email (and therefore on laptops and phones)\n\nIntroduce a new vertical axis representing sensitivity. The higher on the chart, the more sensitive the data.  Ask the participants to rank data.\n\nFor a large group, divide the group into smaller teams for the next steps (it helps if there are relatively clear thematic distinctions within the group, such as nationality, type of work, area of interest, etc.)\n\nProvide stickies to the group(s).  Have the group(s) brainstorm about all of the data they work with, focusing on the most important data first.\n\nParticipants should write ONE type per sticky, and create duplicates if the data is stored in multiple locations.\n\nFor a small group, this can be done as a \"live\" brainstorm.  For larger groups that have been subdivided, have each group finish listing out their most important data and then have each group place the stickies on the matrix.  Invite discussions around the sensitivity of the data.\n\nAn example may look something like this:\n\n![Level Up Backup Matrix Example](images/backup-matrix-example.png)\n\nExplain that this gives us an idea of where our data is. Elicit whether or not this is all the data we generate? Of course it isn't: It's only a small percentage.\n\nThe LevelUp lesson uses this primarily to discuss the importance of backups, and this is a valuable point to make.\n\nCall out the information that they are keeping on their computer's hard drive (which will usually be the fullest one). Elicit some of the things that can cause a computer to stop working. Maybe take a show of hands: Who has had this happen to them?\n\n * Virus or malware attack destroyed a computer or some data\n * Stolen computer, confiscated computer\n * Infrastructural problems, like a power failure broke a computer\n * Inexplicably bricked computer, etc.\n\nFor SAFETAG, we focus on the \"Sensitive data in the wrong hands\" section.  Based on the clustering of sensitive data along the vertical access, choose a column that has an unsual amount of sensitive data (email or computers, usually).\n\nRemove the stickies from the column but keep them in your hand and read them. Now I have this information. What can I do with it? And what are you left with?  Is anyone at risk - yourselves? partners?  If this were published on the Internet, what would happen?\n"
recommendations: >

  Laptops, workstations, servers, external hard drives, and backup systems
  should be configured to use some form of hard drive encryption.

    * For Windows, Microsoft BitLocker is built in to the latest versions, free-of-charge for anyone with a valid Windows 7 “Ultimate” license or Windows 8.

    * For Apple OSX users, FileVault2 is a built-in alternative that is also free-of-charge.

    * TrueCrypt is a cross-platform solution that is open source and free of charge, and can work on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines as well.

  All three solutions provide a way to encrypt data on internal drives as well
  as external hard drives, and USB memory sticks.
