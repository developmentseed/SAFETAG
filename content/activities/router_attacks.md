summary: >

  Many wireless routers still use the default password listed in [“Router
  Default Password Search”](http://www.routerpasswords.com/), meaning that
  anyone with access to the network could also take complete control of the
  router - adding in remote access tools or setting up other attacks.
overview: |2

    * Find the router(s) (``route`` works well for this)
    * Test using default passwords
    * Check for upgrades / un-patched vulnerabilities and backdoors
    * Investigate potentially valuable data (logs, connected users)
