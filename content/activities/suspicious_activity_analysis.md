summary: >
  Malware is a common tactic to target organizations. Malware like a Remote
  Access Trojan (or RAT) can provide an attacker with backdoor access to a
  targeted machine, enabling the attacker to steal information, record audio and
  video, as well as run commands on the infected machine.


  To stop this from happening, you have to identify the malicious process within
  the system and stop it, or reformatting the machine in case you don’t feel
  spending time on stopping the malicious process.


  It’s important to keep evidence, in case the auditee still has access to the
  original malicious software they received (e.g., an email, etc.), keep a copy
  of the file if you have the time and expertise to continue investigating or
  have the resources to submit it to other organizations working on analyzing
  such issues.


  Scanning the possible infected machine or the original suspicious file with an
  anti-virus will save you time and effort, in the case such malware is already
  in its database. Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from
  spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of
  malware.


  After determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the
  staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then
  reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an
  infected machine if you only have a short window of time.


  In case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will
  allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your
  audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on
  investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit
  setting where time is limited. Also see operational security considerations
  that come with replicating the files of a staff member of a sensitive
  organization. Be sure this is absolutely necessary and the staff members
  provides consent before completing.
overview: >

  * Identification and **initial triage/analysis** of suspicious processes,
  files, and emails (via Anti-Virus scanning results, MISP and Virustotal
  information, network traffic analysis, and other research)

  * **Analyzing Specific Suspicious Events/Activities** - If the organization
  have specific concerns or evidence suggesting a targeted attack, the auditor
  can focus attention to match them against any known attacks or flag them for
  further research.


  In the following, you should look for files and URLs that may indicate a
  compromise and may help you identify an infection. If you have time, some
  inital light research may be suggested to see if the URLs or files hashes have
  been identified by other security researchers which can help you provide more
  context to the organization around the types of threats they are facing.
materials_needed: >

  * An Incident Response Plan agreed upon with the organization

  * An emergency contact for the organization

  * A Kali Virtual machine connected to the Internet

  * A [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/) installation (for later
  analysis post audit if you have the expertise)

  * VPN

  * USB drive(s)

  * Large capacity External Hard disk, OS installation media and license keys
considerations: >

  * Consider the time you have, investigating malware can take days (you should
  not investigate during the audit itself)

  * Confirm that the device belongs to the organization

  * Make sure to take the device offline before start working on it

  * Don’t transfer files from the infected machine to any other machines

  * Use a USB drive to move files from the infected machine to your Audit
  machine for investigating proposes

  * Study outputs for any obviously embarrassing personal information

  * Don’t test anything on your virtual machine without VPN
walk_through: >

  *  In case they still have the original binaries (Attachment, email..etc.)

      1.  Download the file to your auditing machine, Scan the file via Anti-Virus or hash the file and use virustotal.com to search for it (Note, don’t upload the actual file to virus total as uploaded files are discoverable by paid subscribers in most cases)

      2.  Check the email’s header and see if it looks suspicious

  *  In case there is no binaries (Attachment, email..etc.) or they have no
  access to it

      1.  Take the machine offline

      2.  In case you have time, Image the hard disk

      3.  Help the auditees to operate another machine to fill the gap of the suspicious machine

      4.  Run a non-depth scan for the machine and try to locate any suspicious files

      5.  Collect the suspicious files, hash them, then search for them on virustotal.com

      6.  Scan the open ports and monitor which applications is connected to external address


  The next sections often are highly interrelated - a phishing email may include
  malicious URLs and/or files, network traffic may include URLs, URLs may try to
  send malicious file downloads.


  **Questions to ask the user / organization**


  * What suspicious behaviors are you witnessing?

  * Where and when are you seeing this behavior? What makes you feel that the
  machine is somehow infected?

  * Do you have an alternative to this machine/process/account you can use it
  until we clear things up?

  * Did you receive any suspicious or unexpected email, attachment or different
  form of communication that made you feel this way?

  * Do you still have access to the original email, attachment or any form of
  communication?
