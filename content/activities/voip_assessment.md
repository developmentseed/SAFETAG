overview: >

  * Investigate any network hardware to determine current patch level and
  potential vulnerabiltiies

  * Research VOIP provider to assess its security (e.g. even on VOIP-to-VOIP
  calls, many providers do not encrypt the traffic across the network)
materials_needed: |

  * Access to the network with VOIP active
