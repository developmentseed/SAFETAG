  While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around
  the office, remote attacks on the organization's website, extranets, and
  unintended information available from "open sources" all pose real threats and
  deserve significant attention.  SAFETAG takes great care to take a very
  passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to
  have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine
  operational security concerns.


  This activity uses active research and scanning to detect known
  vulnerabilities in external and key internal services. Usually penetration
  tests exploit possible vulnerabilities to confirm their existence.
  [^NIST_exploit_confirm] But, the use of exploits puts the organization's
  systems at a level of increased risk [^NIST_pen_test_danger] that is
  unacceptable when neither the organization nor the auditor has the time or
  finances to address the issue. The SAFETAG methodology only uses relatively
  safe exploitation of vulnerabilities for targeted outcomes. For instance,
  cracking the wireless access point password allows us to demonstrate the
  importance of good passwords without singling out any individual's passwords.

overview: >+


  * Identify services being hosted or used by an organization

  * Research externally-facing organization services (websites, services hosted
  from the office, etc.)

  * Research information about identified services (e.g current versions of
  those services.)

  * Run vulnerability scans against websites hosted by the organization,
  externally facing servers run by the organization, and key intranet servers.

  * A Kali VM, bootable USB, or installed system with OWASP ZAP or OpenVAS
  installed, updated, and running\
considerations: >+


  * Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no
  aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.

  * OpenVAS saves its scan records in /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db - this file
  will contain sensitive data, ensure it is stored securely.

  * OpenVAS and other vulnerability scanners can be highly aggressive in their
  tactics.  Tools like Metasploit come with a library of active, functional
  exploits to "prove" that a system is actively vulnerable.  As such, these can
  be tricky to use.  Even OpenVAS on a safe-only scan can appear to a host as an
  active attack, blocking further access from your IP (this can cause some
  annoyance if you are, for example, scanning your host organization's website
  from their network).  Some of these scans and techniques -- again, even the
  "safe" ones -- can also be a violation of local hacking laws.  Get explicit
  permission, give warnings, and be careful.
