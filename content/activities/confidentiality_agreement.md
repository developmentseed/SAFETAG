  * **Negotiate a Confidentiality Agreement:** Negotiate an agreement with the
  organization that outlines how an auditor will protect the privacy of the
  organization and the outcomes of the audit.


  See the Appendix for a DRAFT Engagement and Confidentiality Agreement. See
  also the in-progress [SAFETAG Agreement
  Generator](https://github.com/SAFETAG/safetag_agreement_generator) for  more
  advanced and flexible "plain language" agreement text and guidance on
  selecting which clauses to include.


  ###### Sample Statement of work


  Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment using the SAFETAG framework, to
  include these core methods:


  * Organizational technology capacity assessment

  * Sensitive data and/or process mapping

  * Analysis of operational and technical vulnerabilities

  * Threat actor and context research

  * Creating with the organization and agreed-upon ranking of risks based on the
  above processes


  For each method, the auditor is expected to combine research, interaction with
  key staff members, larger facilitated exercises, and where appropriate,
  technical verifications/investigations to achieve a comprehensive
  understanding of the organization's potential risks.


  ###### Sample Engagement agreement


  In order to protect the privacy of SUBJECT, AUDITOR agrees to comply with the
  following restrictions:

    * AUDITOR commits to prioritizing the stability and integrity of SUBJECT’s digital infrastructure over any additional testing could be carried through more aggressive methods. AUDITOR will make every effort to avoid disrupting SUBJECT's work environment, even temporarily. No tests will be performed that would stress the network, or any individual workstation, beyond what could be expected from normal use. If they has any doubt, AUDITOR will consult with SUBJECT before carrying out the test.
    * AUDITOR will not share the assessment report—or any notes created, data gathered or knowledge obtained about SUBJECT during the evaluation—with anyone other than a single point of contact, designated by SUBJECT. AUDITOR may need to share some general information with SUBJECT staff, as part of requesting information necessary to carry out the audit itself. If AUDITOR has any concern that this could be sensitive, they will first clear it with that point of contact. This commitment to protecting SUBJECT's private information extends to AUDITOR’s colleagues, supervisor and funder, all of whom have demonstrated their own respect for this policy in three previous audits. The only details about the assessment that will be shared, confidentially, with these three groups (and only these three groups) will include: a) the name and location of the organization audited; b) basic time line information; and, with SUBJECT's approval, anonymized “lessons learned,” which will be aggregated with those from at least one other assessment. During and after the audit itself, all data will be stored securely in an encrypted volume on AUDITOR’s computer.
    * AUDITOR will securely delete all data from the audit one week after submitting the final assessment report to SUBJECT or, any time, should SUBJECT's request it.
    * If, at any time, AUDITOR feels that they might be called upon to give advice that could be out of line with SUBJECT's own IT policies, they will first clear it with SUBJECT.
    * AUDITOR will work with whatever level of access SUBJECT is comfortable providing. This includes access to staff members for brief "interviews," as well as more technical access, such as passwords, local connectivity, privileged or unprivileged accounts on local or remote services, etc.. That said, some level of access typically allows an auditor to produce a report that is significantly more useful than the output a pure "black box" audit. (And this is doubly true when the auditor wishes to tread lightly in order to avoid impacting the stability of the subject’s network infrastructure and the productivity of its staff.)
