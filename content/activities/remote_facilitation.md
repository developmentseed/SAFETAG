summary: >
  This component suggests approaches to use if in-person facilitation is not
  possible, and to include participation from remote staff or offices when an
  organization has multiple locations. This supplements the Data Assessment,
  Process Mapping, and Threat Assessment exercises, enabling them to be
  conducted remotely.


  This may not provide as deep results as in-person facilitation, but should
  provide adequate levels of expansion and verification of information needed,
  and even provide the secondary benefits in most cases of helping the
  organization build a shared understanding of its processes, risks, and riosk
  tolerances.
overview: >
  Conducting digital security audit remotely requires great commitment from both
  auditor and the organization. It requires careful planning, scheduling,
  documentation and coordination from both parties. 


  As situations may arise during the course of the project, adherence to the
  activities indicated on the project plan is required. Constant communication
  and participation are the keys for a successful remote audit.


  After preparing the list in "materials_needed", you may first start selecting
  or combining different approaches in conducting remote audit.


  There are four different approaches you can use, depending on what resources
  are available, the size and structure of the organization, and which
  activities you are trying to facilitate remotely. Is there someone that can
  help as an on-site facilitator? Are video conferences realistic (given
  bandwidth and cost)? How does the approach you use interact with existing
  organizational team structures?


  * **Approach 1: On-site facilitator**: This provides the most valuable
  interaction, but requires a person who can take on the facilitation role
  on-site, while the auditor is over video chat.  The facilitator does not have
  to be a technical person, but should be able to manage the session, making
  sure that it is as inclusive and as productive as possible. Accommodates more
  participants per session than Approach 3 per session.


  * **Approach 2, hybrid online/synchronous**: This can be used with a large
  group of participants where it is possible to meet over multiple sessions with
  enough time to collect and analyse responses in between.


  * **Approach 3, multiple small sessions**: Consists of multiple small full
  sessions over video chats, of no more than four participants at a time to
  assure inclusiveness. Suitable for medium to large groups where it is possible
  to conduct multiple small video chats.


  * **Approach 4, hybrid offline/surveys**: This leverages surveys and shorters
  calls or emails. It will provide less information overall, but can be used
  when it is not possible to meet in person, over video chat, or through a local
  facilitator.


  Planning your audit:

    - Number of staff (office based, remote)
    - Schedule (Upcoming calendar events)
    - Availability (Can be 30min to 1hour a day/individual or can be 1 hour for a group of 4-5)
    - Communication method (Video, email, chat)
   
  Depending on which area you are auditing, you may decide on using mixed
  approaches during the course of the audit.


   
   
   
   
   
   
   
materials_needed: >+
  In preparation with the remote facilitation activity, the following materials
  and documentation should be considered.

    * Communication Guidelines
    * Approved communication applications and channels (including fallback communication channels)
    * Questionnaire, survey forms, templates (categorized)
    * Auditing tools: Remote Desktop applications, auditing software (Lynis, Belarc Advisor)
    * Project planning tools (Online Gantt Chart, Task Management etc)



considerations: >
  Remote facilitation, if not done securely, can expose sensitive information
  from both the auditor and the organization. There are different ways to
  communicate and exchange information remotely. This can be by voice calls,
  emails, video conference, survey forms cloud storages and chat messages.
  Choose your tools based on ease of adoption for the organization, proven
  security, and open source, ideally audited code when possible.  
walk_through: >
  Selecting the most suitable approach requires understanding of the capacity
  and personel structure of the organization, including their ability to support
  communication technologies, and the availability of someone that can assist in
  facilitation.


  After selecting the most suitable approach, auditor should make sure to
  prepare for remote facilitation:


  * Work with the organization point of contact to select the most suitable
  approach.

  * Schedule calls/meetings and/or discuss timelines for survey preparation,
  sending, and deadlines for input.

  * Prepare any material to be sent and distributed beforehand.

  * Coordinate (including perhaps training) with on-site facilitator if ny.

  * Prepare at least one fallback communication channel.

  * Test communication channels.
