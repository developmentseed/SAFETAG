  Based on the specific recommendations in the audit report, as well as the
  auditor's understanding of the organization's capacity and barriers faced,
  introduce the relevant points of contact at the organization to resources such
  as digital security trainers, funding organizations which provide targeted
  support for digital security, technical experts to help on specific tasks
  (e.g. server hardening, website migration), as well as services that could
  help address their needs (e.g. secure hosting providers, rapid response
  support).


  Follow up with both the organization and the resources introduced to check in
  on process and revise which introductions you make going forward.
