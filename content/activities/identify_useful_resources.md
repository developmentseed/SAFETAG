walk_through: >

  A SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil
  society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security
  training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response. As
  SAFETAG auditors develop deep knowledge of regional and global resources
  available the organizations they audit will have a greater chance of
  identifying resources that they can use. As auditors share resources they have
  identified back to the SAFETAG network, each auditor's possible impact can be
  increased.
