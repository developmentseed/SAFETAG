summary: >

  The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus
  and other security capabilities, and identifies software runing on computers
  and its current version.  The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any
  out of date software.


  This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software
  can lead to large vulnerabilities.
overview: >

  * You can do this as a focused activity where staff walk you through a usual
  "day in their life" showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and
  what data they have to interact with to conduct their work; or this can be
  integrated with other formal and informal activities/interactions where you
  ask staff questions on their usage of technology and remote services
materials_needed: ''
considerations: >

  * Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are
  treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e.
  explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the
  organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in
  aggregate.


  * If using screen sharing, use a service with transport security and "lock"
  the room or make sure the user knows to end the call if anyone unexpected
  joins the room (unlikely)
walk_through: >

  As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist
  activity), also interview them about the other devices they use, and how they
  connect to work services - email/webmail, intra/extranet tools, Constituent
  Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial
  tracking tools, and website management tools.


  This can also be done remotely. Ask to have the staff member use a
  screensharing tool (meet.jit.si or appear.in offer easy-to-use, browser based
  options) so that you can watch how they interact with their computer and what
  applications are active in the background.
