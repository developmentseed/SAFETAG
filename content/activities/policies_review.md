  context, looking for existing policies, understanding how they translate into

  improvements or updates.

  * Review written policies with security implications

  * Identify any areas for improvement in existing policies

  * Leveraging output from Process Mapping, Capacity Assessment, and Data
  Mapping; identify policy gaps
materials_needed: ''
considerations: ''
walk_through: >

  1. Ask for documentation - this may come out of Capacity Assessment work

  2. Review documentation and compare with existing baselines, and against
  identified vulnerabilities - do these policies help mitigate risks? (see
  references)

  3. Propose a map like the one in the Identifying Informal Agreements activity
recommendations: >

  There must be a good understanding of the organizational capacity and
  commitment to implementing and maintaining formal security policies. Based on
  this assessment, consider beginning with more informal agreements among staff
  which still help centralize their approach to security and improve their
  preventative measures and ability to respond to incidents that is easy and
  effective to adopt. Encourage a "testing" phase of these practices for the
  organization to then begin formalizing the ones which work and test new
  approaches for any which did not continue.
