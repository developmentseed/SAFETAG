summary: >

  The auditor checks staff devices for updated systems and software, anti-virus
  and other security capabilities, and identifies software running on computers
  and its current version.  The auditor checks for known vulnerabilities to any
  out of date software.


  This is used to develop a report component exposing how un-updated software
  can lead to large vulnerabilities.
overview: |2+

   * Identify what privilege level services are running under -- Are users using accounts with admin privileges, or are they using another user and have to type in a password to get admin rights? [^privilege-separation-across-os]
   * Check for existence and status of anti-virus (and anti-malware tools) on the device. [^anti-virus-updates]
   * Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. [^identifying-software-versions]
   * Identify what level of encryption is being used and is available for data storage on the device. [^device_encryption_by_os]
   * Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.

  * A notepad may be useful
considerations: >

  * Communicate with the staff members the level of confidentiality you are
  treating discussions around their device and technology usage with - i.e.
  explain what incident response triggers you have agreed upon with the
  organization, and that anything not triggering that is to be only reported in
  aggregate.
walk_through: >

  The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work
  & personal).  The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope
  creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational
  accounts/data, the auditor should share what "red flags" they are looking for
  and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it
  may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should
  use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.


  As you work with staff members, also interview them about the other devices
  they use such as phones and tablets, and how they connect to work services -
  email/webmail, chat Apps, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship
  Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools,
  and website management tools.


  Below is a checklist to assist in checking across different platforms/versions
  for common security needs.
