  * A secure, real-time VOIP system is recommended for this call, as many of the

  (https://ostel.co/).

  This can be combined with the Staff Feedback Survey exercise, or to follow up
  on any concerns you have based on their responses to that survey.  The main
  goal of the long-term follow-up is to ensure that the organization has ongoing
  connection points to any resources or connections they need to remove barriers
  to adoption.
