title: Organizational Policy Review
summary: >
  This methodology explores existing organizational practices, informal
  agreements, and policies around managing information security and responding
  to threats. It also seeks to reveal presumptions made within the organization
  which are neither shared  (informal or no) nor codified in policies.
purpose: >
  Many smaller organizations do not have formal policies around information
  security. This is not inherently a good or bad thing, as in their place are
  often informal agreements and practices. The goal of this component is to
  reveal any presumptions that are not shared, and help set more formalized
  agreements across the organization, and to cross-verify these policies,
  practices, guidelines, and informal agreements with what is actually taking
  place (generally using activities from data assessment and device assessment
  methodologies).


  * Identify what (if any) baseline policies or informal agreements exist to
  respond to common information security and business continuity challenges

  * Clarify any presumptions being made but not effectively shared

  * List of existing agreements and gaps?

  * Resources to formalize/expand agreements to policies

  * Onboarding checklist (entry/exit policies?)
guiding_questions: >

  * Are there documented policies or practices, including any employee
  onboarding guidance?

  * What is the level of formality of the security practices in place? are
  verbal conventions, written documents or something in between?

  * What is the understanding by the management and/or staff on common security
  practices?

  * Are there presumptions being made by some staff which are not shared?

  * How are any of these implemented / required / verified within existing
  organizational practice?


  Specific aspects to explore are:


  * Password expectations (password management, complexity, requirements

  * entry/exit policies and account management

  * information classification that limits access (e.g. who has access to
  financial data? partner data?)

  * Backups

  * Acceptable use policies (what can and cannot staff do with their work
  devices)

  * Travel policies (VPN usage, etc.)
approaches: >

  * Request for and review of documented policies

  * Interviews with staff members at different levels (if that exists)

  * Informal 1:1 discussions and technical verification of the implementation of
  any mentioned agreements
output: >

  * List of existing agreements and policies and their gaps

  * Resources to formalize/expand agreements to policies

  * Providing initial support to help the organization decide on and agree to
  baseline guidance around critical digital security controls, such as an
  Onboarding checklist, entry/exit policies, etc

preparation: >

  If (through interviews or even the audit agreement process); you have received
  copies of policies, a thorough review of the written policies is required to
  assess if they are being followed, enforced, or have changed since being
  formalized.
