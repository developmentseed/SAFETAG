title: Organizational Device Usage
summary: >

  This component allows the auditor to discover and assess the security of the
  devices on the network and/or used in the organization. This component
  consists of interviews, surveys, network mapping, and inspection of devices.
purpose: >

  Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other
  organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive
  basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist
  against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host
  more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data,
  it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides,
  including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not
  overlooked.
guiding_questions: >

  * What work and personal devices do staff use to accomplish their work, store
  work related files, or engage in work communications?

  * What organizational and external/personal services  do staff use to
  accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work
  communications?

  * How do staff communicate internal and external? What tools do they use?

  * What are the existing in/formal security practices that the participants use
  to address risks.

  * Who has physical access to what? Who has remote access to what?

  * When are devices not monitored by trusted staff?

  * How could adversaries gain access? (forced entry, theft, social engineering,
  seizure)

  * Are there mitigation procedures if devices are lost or taken by adversaries?
  (e.g.: encrypted drives, offsite backups?)
approaches: >

  * **Physical Access to Devices:** Tour the office and look for logged in
  devices without users, servers, network jacks, written down passwords and
  document how difficult it would be for a visitor or after-hours break-in to
  access sensitive systems. Have staff take a physical security security

  * **Conduct a Hands on  Device Interview/Audit:** Inspect and record
  information on user devices (work & personal) for security concerns (existance
  of passwords, patch levels, user privileges, drive encryption, ports/services
  running, anti-virus capabilities)

  * **Password User Survey:** Have staff take the password use survey for ALL
  devices used for work. [^password_survey]^,^[^password-security]

  * **A Day In the Life:** Have staff walk you through a usual "day in their
  life" showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and what data they
  have to interact with to conduct their work.
