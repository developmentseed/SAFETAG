  * What work and personal devices do staff use to accomplish their work, store
  work related files, or engage in work communications?

  * What organizational and external/personal services  do staff use to
  accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work
  communications?

  * How do staff communicate internal and external? What tools do they use?

  * What are the existing in/formal security practices that the participants use
  to address risks.

  * Who has physical access to what? Who has remote access to what?

  * When are devices not monitored by trusted staff?

  * How could adversaries gain access? (forced entry, theft, social engineering,
  seizure)

  * Are there mitigation procedures if devices are lost or taken by adversaries?
  (e.g.: encrypted drives, offsite backups?)

  * List of all assets in the organization and whom they belong to.

  * Notes on un/documented access controls measures for the office

  * List of software running on staff devices and date of last update

  * List of known vulnerabilities, and identifiable malware, that the office is
  vulnerable to.

  * List of malware found by running updated anti-virus on office computers (if
  anti-virus installed during device inspection.)

  * List of specific unsecured servers, workstations, external hard   drives and
  any other digital resources

  * Notes on existing security measures for all digital systems

  * Written-down passwords
   
purpose: >

  Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other
  organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive
  basic software and security updates/upgrades and what core protections exist
  against unauthorized access is vital to designing a strategy to make the host
  more secure. Because the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data,
  it's also crucial that the physicality of devices on which this data resides,
  including the hard-wired networks through which it's exchanged, be not
  overlooked.

summary: >

  This component allows the auditor to discover and assess the security of the
  devices on the network and/or used in the organization. This component
  consists of interviews, surveys, network mapping, and inspection of devices.
