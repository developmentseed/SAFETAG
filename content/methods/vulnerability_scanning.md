title: Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis
summary: >
  This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's
  devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing
  them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability
  databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known
  vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side
  the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network,
  however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after
  the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on
  site.
purpose: >

  It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to run critical
  infrastructure themselves on available equipment. A better-resourced
  organization may host its critical services at a remote data center, or
  outsource its IT infrastructure to cloud providers, such as Google Apps,
  and/or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). Regardless,
  it is rare to have someone designated to update and patch systems as
  vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as
  opposed to availability -- standpoint.
guiding_questions: >

  * What level of proof do you need to identify to convey the importance (or
  importance) of a vulnerability to the organization?

  * What would the organization and IT think is an appropriate amount of the IT
  staffs time that you can request to get the information you need?
approaches: >

  * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Run vulnerability scans against websites,
  externally facing servers, and key intranet servers.

  * **Explore Vulnerability Databases:**  Search vulnerability databases for
  potential risks to systems and software used on servers, user devices, and
  online services.

  * **Examine Service Configuration Files:** Examine configuration files for
  vulnerabilities  using "hardening", or "common mistake" guides found online.

  #### Baseline Skills


  * **Vulnerability Scanning:** : General TCP/IP and networking knowledge;
  knowledge of ports, protocols, services, and vulnerabilities for a variety of
  operating systems; ability to use automated vulnerability scanning tools and
  interpret/analyze the results
