title: Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis
summary: >
  This component has the auditor discover possible flaws the organization's
  devices, services, application designs, and networks by testing and comparing
  them against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability
  databases, vendor advisories, and auditor investigation) to identify known
  vulnerabilities. Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side
  the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network,
  however, deeper research into specific discovered exploits can happen after
  the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on
  site.
purpose: >

  It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to run critical
  infrastructure themselves on available equipment. A better-resourced
  organization may host its critical services at a remote data center, or
  outsource its IT infrastructure to cloud providers, such as Google Apps,
  and/or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). Regardless,
  it is rare to have someone designated to update and patch systems as
  vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as
  opposed to availability -- standpoint.
guiding_questions: >

  * What level of proof do you need to identify to convey the importance (or
  importance) of a vulnerability to the organization?

  * What would the organization and IT think is an appropriate amount of the IT
  staffs time that you can request to get the information you need?
operational_security: |2+

    * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
    * Use VPNs or Tor to search if scanning remotely.
    * Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - *NOTE:*  The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the organization.
    * In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the network.

  #### Baseline Skills


  * **Vulnerability Scanning:** : General TCP/IP and networking knowledge;
  knowledge of ports, protocols, services, and vulnerabilities for a variety of
  operating systems; ability to use automated vulnerability scanning tools and
  interpret/analyze the results


  * **Penetration Testing:** Extensive TCP/IP, networking, and OS knowledge;
  advanced knowledge of network and system vulnerabilities and exploits;
  knowledge of techniques to evade security detection
outputs: "\n  * Lists of OVAL/CVE identifiers for each possibly vulnerable service/system.\n  * Examples of live exploits for vulnerabilities where possible.\n  * A short write up of each vulnerability including how it was identified.\n  * The cleaned up output from any tests used to identify the vulnerability.\n\n  * Document Vulnerabilities (per vulnerability)\n    * Write Up\n      * Summary - A short (two to three sentence) basic overview of the vulnerability, including a discussion of potential impacts.\n      * Description - An in-depth (one to three paragraph) overview of the vulnerability.\n      * Approach - Step-by-step explanation of the methodology used that is tool agnostic.\n\t  * Proof - The cleaned up output from tests run to identify the vulnerability.\n"
