  * What are the barriers the organization faced in implementing the recommended
  risk mitigation plan?

  * Are there new resources that the auditor can provide to supplement the
  original audit?

  * What can you do to make your follow up perceived as additional support
  instead of as an evaluation of their success?

  Follow up can be a valuable tool for encouraging an organization to continue
  their digital security process. But, follow up needs to be desired by an
  organization and achievable for the auditor. As such, follow up must be
  minimally intrusive on both the auditor and the host's time.

summary: >
  This component allows an auditor to explain and get feedback on their report
  as well as evaluate the success of the process over time through a continued
  relationship with the host.


  This component consists of the final meeting with the host and following up
  with them after a period of a few months to see if they need further
  assistance, are willing to share their experience working with any of the
  recommended resources, or as new resources are identified.
