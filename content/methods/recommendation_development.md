title: Report Creation and Recommendation Development
summary: >+

  In this component the auditor identifies the organization's strengths and
  weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to
  adopting new digital and physical security practices and documents the
  possible actions the organization could take on to address the vulnerabilities
  found during the audit, the difficulty of taking on those actions, and the
  resources that the host may be able to leverage to address them. Resources can
  include, but are not limited to, local technical support and incident response
  groups/trade organizations, places to obtain discount software, trainers, and
  guides/resrouces they can use to support their up-skilling.

purpose: >

  The host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations
  that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that
  allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more
  comprehensively in the long-term. Knowing an organization's strengths and
  weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations
  that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve.  In doing
  this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit
  between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing
  digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and
  incident response. 
guiding_questions: >

  * What are the organizational areas of strength  (expertise, finance,
  willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that the organization can leverage
  when engaging in technological adoption/change?

  * What are the organizational areas of weakness  (expertise, finance,
  willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) that need to be taken into
  consideration when engaging in technological adoption/change?

  * What are the organizational barriers to adoption?

  * Are the recommendations you are providing directly related to the security
  audit? If not, do they support the organization in accomplishing their
  security tasks, or distract from them? 
outputs: |2

    * Short-term recommendations to address each vulnerability.
    * Long-term recommendations to address each vulnerability.
    * Summaries of why recommendations were not given for any vulnerabilities or adversaries.
    * Lists of organizations that can assist the host accomplish their task.
    * Lists of educational resources the organization can use for training.
    * Contact information for recommended trainers who can help with digital security training.
operational_security: |2

    * Treat the data and analyses of this step with the utmost security.
    * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.
    * Do not share any organization information or data when reaching out to possible resources.
