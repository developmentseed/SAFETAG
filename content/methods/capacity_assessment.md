title: Capacity Assessment
summary: >
  In this component the auditor engages with staff through both formal
  interviews and informal conversations to identify the organization's strengths
  and weakness (expertise, finance, willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) to
  adopting new digital and physical security practices. The auditor uses this
  information to modify the audit scope and recommendations accordingly.
purpose: >
  Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses allows the auditor to
  provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely
  to attempt and achieve. The auditor will use this assessment in preparing for
  the audit itself as well as when evaluating the difficulty of a
  recommendation. This information also provides a starting place for
  understanding the organization's current use and understanding of technology,
  digital security, and current threat landscape, as well as revealing elements
  of an organization's workflow, infrastructure and even vulnerabilities that
  you might otherwise have overlooked.
guiding_questions: |2-

   * What is the organization's ability to adopt new technologies or practices?
   * What resources does the organization have available to them?
   * What is the environment that the organization works within like? What barriers, threat actors, and other aspects influence their work?
   * Are there any specific considerations for the audit that would require modifying the overall approach, tools, preparation steps, or timeline?

   
approaches: |2

   * Conduct pre-audit interviews with key managerial and technical staff to identify organizational areas of strength and weakness (expertise, finance, staff time, etc.).
   * Have informal conversations with staff during the course of the audit to further gather capacity and historical "stories" of technology adoption.
   * Generate easy to follow capacity self-assessment checklist, which can be continuously used and modified by the organisation over time.
