purpose: >
  A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that
  time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the
  auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with
  the SAFETAG framework. To that end negotiations with the host organization
  help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the audit and
  respond to its findings.
