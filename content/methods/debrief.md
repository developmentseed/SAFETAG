title: Debrief
summary: >

  This component consists of an out-brief to key points of contact, providing
  basic pressure relief through group and individual interactions, and planning
  future follow-up with the host and key individuals.
purpose: >

  SAFETAG is an auditing framework designed to connect small civil society
  organizations and independent media outlets to the digital security services
  they need. But, more than that it is designed to provide audits that increase
  an organization's agency to seek out and address security challenges
  independently. This can be an auditor's last in-person chance to engage with
  the staff to shape their perspective of the audit.


  The debrief allows the auditor to ensure that they leave the host and its
  staff ready to start addressing their digital security. By providing some
  immediate outcomes to the host and its staff, initial psycho-social care and
  re-framing as needed, and in combination with training or security
  consultation in the Responsive Support section, the auditor can ensure that
  the host sees the audit as a guide instead of a condemnation.
