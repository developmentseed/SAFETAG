title: User Device Assessment
summary: >
  This component allows the auditor to assess the security of the individual
  devices on the network. This component consists of interviews, surveys, and
  inspection of devices.
purpose: >

  Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other
  organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive
  basic software and security upgrades and what core protections against
  unauthorized access exist is vital to designing a strategy to make the host
  more secure.
guiding_questions: >
  * What work and personal devices do staff use to accomplish their work, store
  work related files, or engage in work communications?

  * What organizational and external/personal services  do staff use to
  accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work
  communications?

  * What are the organizational processes that staff take part in and the tools
  and communication channels that are used in those process'?

  * What are the existing in/formal security practices that the participants use
  to address risks.
approaches: >

  * **Conduct a Hands on  Device Interview/Audit:** Inspect and record
  information on user devices (work & personal) for security concerns (patch
  levels, user privileges, drive encryption, ports/services running, anti-virus
  capabilities)

  * **Password User Survey:** Have staff take the password use survey for ALL
  devices used for work. [^password_survey]^,^[^password-security]

  * **A Day In the Life:** Have staff walk you through a usual "day in their
  life" showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and what data they
  have to interact with to conduct their work.
