  * What work and personal devices do staff use to accomplish their work, store
  work related files, or engage in work communications?

  * What organizational and external/personal services  do staff use to
  accomplish their work, store work related files, or engage in work
  communications?

  * What are the organizational processes that staff take part in and the tools
  and communication channels that are used in those process'?

  * What are the existing in/formal security practices that the participants use
  to address risks.

outputs: >

  * List of all assets in the organization and whom they belong to.

  * List of software running on staff devices.

  * List of known vulnerabilities, and identifiable malware, that the office is
  vulnerable to.

  * List of malware found by running updated anti-virus on office computers (if
  anti-virus installed during device inspection.)
purpose: >

  Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other
  organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive
  basic software and security upgrades and what core protections against
  unauthorized access exist is vital to designing a strategy to make the host
  more secure.
