title: Data Assessment
summary: >
  This component allows the auditor to identify what sensitive data exists for
  the organization, where it is stored, and how it is transferred.
purpose: >+
  Sensitive files are often stored across multiple devices with different levels
  of security. A data assessment allows the auditor to recommend secure storage
  solutions which best meet the organizations risk assessment and workflow
  needs. While the auditor has insight on some of this based on the Network
  Access and Network Mapping work, cross-staff understanding and agreement on
  what constitutes sensitive data will support later organizational change.


  An adversary who obtains a laptop, workstation, or backup drive will be able
  to read or modify sensitive information on the device, even if that staff
  member has set a strong account password. This applies to threats involving
  loss, theft, and confiscation, but also to "checkpoint" scenarios in which
  they may only have access for a few minutes. Furthermore, in the event of a
  burglary or office raid, an adversary could obtain all sensitive information
  on the organization's devices, possibly even undetected.

guiding_questions: >

  * What are the most important data sets to keep available? Are there backups?

  * What are the most important data sets to keep private?

  * How does the organization currently determine who should have access to
  data?

  * Is there currently anyone who has access to data who should not?

  * Does the staff agree on what constitutes sensitive data?

  * What data does each staff member need to be able to access in order to do
  their job?
approaches: >

  * **Data Mapping Activity:** Have staff identify where that data is currently
  (what devices/physical locations), who has access (physical, login,
  permissions), and who needs to have access to get the organizations work
  completed.

  *  **Risks of Data Lost and Found Activity:** Have rank the impact if
  different data within the organization was lost, and if adversaries gained
  access to that data.

  * **Private Data Activity:** Guide staff through an activity to have them list
  private data within the organization [^personal_information_to_keep_private]


  If it was not possible to conduct these activities in person, you can conduct
  them remotely through applying one of the remote facilitation approaches
  described in the [Remote Facilitation](#appendix-remote-facilitation)
  appendix.
preparation: |

  * Facilitation skills or experience is useful for these exercises
  * Carefully review the exercises you plan to use
