  * Are there any critical vulnerabilities or remediation activities that the
  organization needs a deeper understanding to give proper weight to in the
  report?

  * How can you prepare the staff and management for aspects of the audit
  process might lead to alienation or inhibit the process?

  * What is the organization's readiness and likelihood to succeed in engaging
  with security technology?  What factors will complicate or inhibit the
  effective and safe uptake and use?

  * Is the support you want to provide (troubleshooting, fixes, upgrades,
  training, etc.) critical to the security of the organization? If not, can you
  provide that support without taking away from the audit?

  * Will you have the capacity to support software or hardware that you provided
  while providing support?
