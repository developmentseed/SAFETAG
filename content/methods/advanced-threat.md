  - Suspicious Activity Analysis
title: Advanced Threat
summary: This component allows the auditor to be able to identify, triage, and
  analyze suspicious behavior on a device or in a network. Depending on the
  analysis, the auditor may need to further investigate a malware infection,
  analyze a binary and determine if it is malicious or not, and recommend urgent
  mitigation steps.
purpose: It is very common to find suspicious behaviors, processes, traffic and
  other ‘weird activities’ during a SAFETAG audit. SAFETAG practitioners should
  always be on the lookout for suspicious activities as they apply other SAFETAG
  methods and their activities, from interactions and discussions with staff to
  hands-on device assessment and traffic analysis.
