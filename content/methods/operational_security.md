title: Physical and Operational Security
summary: >

  The organizational security methodology is focused on how to mitigate against
  threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the
  physical world -- how secure are the devices at an organization's office,
  where and how staff travel with organizational devices, and whether staff work
  outside of the office (e.g. in remote offices, at their homes, while
  traveling, or at cafes).  Further, is organizational information accessed from
  personal devices, and how are those devices secured?
purpose: >
  While the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, the
  physicality of devices, backup drives, servers, and even hard-wired networks
  cannot be overlooked.


  For many organizations, digital threats that depend on physical access are
  considered the least probable. So much so, that many security specialists
  concede that there is no proper defense against an attacker with physical
  access to sensitive hardware. While there is some truth to this, it is not
  useful advice for small scale civil society organizations or independent media
  houses. The risks that advocacy and media organizations face are far more
  varied, and the cost of lost information can be crippling to their ability to
  operate.


  Depending on the specific threats for each organization, the auditor should
  consider the challenges of not only one-time exfiltration of data as well as
  potential ways an adversary could use physical access or proximity to the
  organization or its devices to gain ongoing remote access, track, or cause
  harm to the organization through the outright destruction of data.
guiding_questions: >

  * Who has physical access to what? When are devices not monitored by trusted
  staff?

  * Who has independent access to the office space?

  * How could adversaries gain access? (forced entry, theft, social engineering,
  seizure)

  * How are daily devices used and stored -- where are they when employees go
  home?

  * Where are the servers and network components that host and manage the
  organizations assets? Are there active network jacks that are unused, are they
  in public spaces, are they in places where people would not notice if there
  was somthing plugged into them?

  * How is data accessed and stored outside of the organization's main
  offices/workspaces?

  * Do staff travel with organizational information?

  * How are backups managed? Where are they stored?
approaches: >

  * **Physical Access to the Lan, wifi, and Servers:** Tour the office and look
  for exposed network devices, servers, and network jacks, document how
  difficult it would be for a visitor or after-hours break-in to access
  sensitive systems. Determine the reach of the wireless network and how easy it
  is to identify it as connected to the organization.

  * **Mapping potential physical vulnerabilities with digital security
  impacts:**  Document potential vulnerabilities to the organization's
  information security based on physical aspects -- e.g. unencrypted devices
  which could be stolen, written passwords, or even wireless network metadata.

  * **A Day In the Life:** Have staff walk you through a usual "day in their
  life" showing you what devices they use, how they use them, and what data they
  have to interact with to conduct their work.
